## What is [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

Leiningen is a dependency management tool with customized commands, like yarn to Javascript. It is mature and reliable. Though Clojure CLI can [manage dependency](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli) now, Leiningen has been there for a while. It, therefore, has more documents and templates. Before the full migration to CLI is done, learning Leiningen can benefit your Clojure projects.

## How to Install

Here is the official installation method:

> Leiningen and Clojure require Java; ideally OpenJDK.
>
> 1. Download the [lein script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein) (or on Windows [lein.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.bat))
> 2. Place it on your `$PATH` where your shell can find it (eg. `~/bin`)
> 3. Set it to be executable (chmod a+x ~/bin/lein)
> 4. Run it (lein) and it will download the self-install package
