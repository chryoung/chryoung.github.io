## Rationale

[re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) is a reactive front-end framework written in ClojureScript. With [figwheel](https://figwheel.org/), a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) like development experience can be achieved. However, the CSS still needs reloading to reflect the style change. To remove this limitation, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) can be integrated with re-frame.
